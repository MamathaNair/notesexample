This week, Torrentz, the world’s largest torrent search engine, closed without notice or explanation. Two of the largest sites in piracy have blinked out—but that won’t speed piracy’s steady decline."

      "content":"J.K. ROWLING’S HARRY Potter fantasy series supposedly ended in 2007 with the publication of the seventh and final book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. But nearly a decade after Rowling’s original story ended—and five years after the movie versions wound down—she’s expanding her Wizarding World empire in increasingly diverse ways. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme parks have opened in Orlando, Hollywood, and Osaka, Japan. Rowling has moved into screenwriting, adapting her charity textbook Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them into an upcoming film trilogy starring Eddie Redmayne. She’s writing about the history of magic in America on her company hub Pottermore. And after years cultivating other parts of the franchise, she’s dipped back into the lives of her main characters."
